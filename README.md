## Code Hero 

Code Hero is a real time IDE powered by React.JS, Ace IDE and Firebase! 

To get started you will need a Firebase account and project setup with public permissions.
 
Next you will need to create a file names '/src/config.js' that looks something like this: 
 
const firebase_config_url = 'https://PROJECT_ID.firebaseio.com';

export default firebase_config_url;  

Next run the project and have fun coding live with friends. 

Please note this project is a proof of concept and not designed for production use (yet.)

Happy hacking! ðŸ˜‰
